# webtoons-downloader

A simple program to download comics from [Webtoons](https://www.webtoons.com/en/), because I am a compulsive hoarder.

## Usage

The program is written in [Go](https://golang.org), so just set it up and run `go build`. Alternatively, for Windows binaries, look in releases.

In CLI, run:

```
./webtoons-downloader -u <url> -o comic
```

URL in this case is the url of the chapter list page of the comic. Like, the page with a list of all the chapters.
